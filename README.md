# NLP_Toxic_Classification
This is a project about Toxic Comment Classification using different methods both for English and Greek.

To Run the Code you will need to download these datasets and add them to the Data and Data_GR directories.

glove840b300d -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/takuok/glove840b300dtxt
glove6B50d -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/watts2/glove6b50dtxt

Additionally, you will need to create the Models and Predictions directories in the NLP_English directory. 
You will have to do the same for the NLP_Greek directory, but the name will be Models_GR and Predictions_GR.
